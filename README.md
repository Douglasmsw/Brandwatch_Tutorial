# Brandwatch_Tutorial

[Here you can find a manual]([url](https://github.com/Douglasmsw/My_Brandwatch_Tutorials/blob/main/Brandwatch%20Projects%20Monitor%20Manual.pdf)) I made for non-technical employees who needed to use a consumer data dashboard I'd built up while working an internship. There are some details and analysis redacted and a few of my video tutorials de-linked because they display client analysis. I did include one video on query writing from a practice query set so hopefully you can find that useful / interesting.

This manual / video assumes basic knowledge of the Brandwatch platform, which allows a user to use boolean logic to scrape text from the internet and do some analysis. There are some beginner query writing resources like the Operators Appendix and the query writing video. It covers how to write queries to pull data and then how to set up a dashboard to track basic information like sentiment, traffic, authors, and mention volume.

It's a super useful platform and they publish some simple blog content on the natural language processing happening on the background that's pretty cool.

*Note: I know the last couple page numbers do not line up with the table of contents, when redacting they shifted up a bit. I'm too lazy to go and edit the table of contents so we're just gonna have to live with it.
