# Brandwatch_Tutorial

Here you can find a manual I made for non-technical employees who needed to use a consumer data dashboard I'd built up while working an internship. There are some details and analysis redacted and a few videos de-linked because they display client analysis. I did include one video on query writing from a practice query set so hopefully you can find that useful / interesting.

This manual / video assumes basic knowledge of the Brandwatch platform, which allows a user to use boolean logic to scrape text from the internet and do some analysis. There are some beginner query writing resources like the Operators Appendix and the query writing video.

More details on Brandwatch can be found here: https://www.brandwatch.com
It's a super useful platform and they publish some simple blog content on the natural language processing happening on the background that's pretty cool.
